# HiddenArmor
This plugin allows players to hide their armor so their skins are always visible to everyone.

Command: /togglearmor - Hides your own armor

All configuration is explained in the config.yml file.


### Available Placeholders

- `%hiddenarmor_armorvisibility%` - Returns "Enabled" or "Disabled" based on whether the player has armor visibility toggled on
- `%hiddenarmor_armorhidden%` - Returns "Enabled" or "Disabled" based on whether the player's armor is currently hidden (considers game mode and invisibility effects)
